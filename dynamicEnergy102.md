## For Non-Developers ðŸŒŸ

### What is the DynamicEnergy Pallet?

The **DynamicEnergy** pallet provides mechanisms for managing energy dynamics, including burning, selling, and generating energy. By adjusting parameters such as APR and exchange rates, this pallet ensures energy operations remain aligned with network conditions. It also tracks energy generation and updates exchange rates dynamically.

### Key Concepts

- **Energy Burn Override**: Allows overriding the default energy burned value for recalibration.  
- **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**: Sets the default rate of energy returns, configurable by administrators.  
- **Smooth Factors**: Control how quickly generation and exchange rates respond to changes.

## Available Operations

### **Force Set Energy Burn**
- **What it does**: Overrides the energy burn value used in network calculations.  
- **When to use it**: Use this to align the burn rate with updated energy dynamics.  
- **Example**: Increasing the burn rate during high-traffic periods for better energy allocation.  
- **Important to know**: Only administrators can execute this operation.  

---

### **Update Exchange Rate**
- **What it does**: Calculates and updates the exchange rate between assets and energy.  
- **When to use it**: Use this to ensure that the exchange rate remains fair and reflects network conditions.  
- **Example**: Adjusting the exchange rate to account for increased energy sales.  
- **Important to know**: Exchange rates directly impact market trades.
