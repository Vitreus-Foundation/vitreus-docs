# Dynamic VNRG ELI15

## Introduction

Welcome to the Dynamic VNRG guide! This document explains in simple, everyday language what Dynamic VNRG is, how it works, and why it matters. You don't need a technical background to understand the basics of how our system keeps the VNRG token balanced and stable.

## What is Dynamic VNRG?

Dynamic VNRG is a system that automatically adjusts the value of the VNRG token based on network activity. Think of it like a smart thermostat that keeps your home at the right temperature—only here, it keeps the token’s value in balance.

- **VNRG:** The token or digital currency used in our network.
- **Dynamic:** Means the value changes automatically depending on how much energy the network uses and exchanges.

## How Does It Work?

At its simplest, Dynamic VNRG watches two key activities in the network:

1. **Energy Burn:**  
   - This is like the "fuel" the network uses when actions take place. When energy is "burned," it is recorded as a measure of network activity.

2. **Energy Sale:**  
   - This measures the energy that’s being sold or exchanged for tokens.

Using these numbers, the system calculates two important things:

- **Generation Rate:**  
  How many new VNRG tokens are created based on the energy burned.

- **Exchange Rate:**  
  How many VNRG tokens you receive in exchange for energy. This calculation also considers how much energy is stored (in what we call the "warehouse") and other factors like the annual percentage rate (APR).

### Smoothing: Making Changes Gradual

To avoid sudden and unpredictable shifts in value:
- The system **smooths** the numbers by blending recent data with past data.  
- This gradual adjustment is like turning a dial slowly instead of making a sudden jump, which helps keep the token value stable and predictable.

## Why Does Dynamic VNRG Matter?

Dynamic VNRG is important because it helps maintain a fair and balanced system. Here’s why it matters to you:

- **Stability:**  
  The token value is adjusted smoothly based on real network activity, reducing the chance of wild swings.

- **Fairness:**  
  The system reflects what is actually happening in the network. When activity is high or low, the token value adjusts accordingly.

- **Incentives:**  
  A stable and fair system can encourage more participation by rewarding active use and ensuring a balanced economy.

- **Adaptability:**  
  The mechanism can be fine-tuned by network administrators to address issues or adapt to new conditions, ensuring the system remains robust over time.

## When Do These Changes Happen?

- **Regular Sessions:**  
  The system updates its calculations at regular intervals called "sessions."  
  - At the end of each session, it takes the recent energy burn and sale numbers and recalculates the generation and exchange rates.

- **Automatic Adjustments:**  
  Most changes happen automatically as part of normal network operations.

- **Manual Overrides:**  
  In special cases, network administrators can manually adjust the settings if needed (for example, during testing or to correct errors).

## Who Controls It?

- **Automated System:**  
  The system mostly runs on its own, using preset rules and data from the network.

- **Network Administrators:**  
  Trusted administrators have special controls to override automatic settings when necessary. This ensures that if something unexpected happens, the system can be quickly corrected.

## How Do You Benefit as a User?

- **Predictability:**  
  Because changes are gradual, you won’t see sudden spikes or drops in token value.

- **Transparency:**  
  The rules behind how the token value is calculated are clear, so you know what to expect based on network activity.

- **Security:**  
  Automated adjustments help keep the network healthy, which in turn protects your assets.

## In Summary

Dynamic VNRG is like a self-adjusting engine that powers the value of the VNRG token. It listens to how much energy is being used and exchanged, then makes small, smooth adjustments to keep everything running steadily. This creates a system that is stable, fair, and responsive to real-world activity.
