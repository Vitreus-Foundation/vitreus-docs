## Overview

The Dynamic Energy pallet manages on-chain parameters for calculating energy generation and exchange rates dynamically. It does so by:

- Tracking **energy burn** and **energy sale** events during sessions.
- Calculating rates using smoothing functions to blend new measurements with historical data.
- Providing administrative overrides to simulate or correct system behavior.
- Adjusting economic parameters such as the annual percentage rate (APR) and warehouse capacity multiplier coefficients.

## Storage Items & Key Concepts

- **Energy & Stake Overrides:**  
  - **EnergyBurnOverride:** Manually override the automatically accumulated energy burn.
  - **EnergySaleOverride:** Manually override the automatically accumulated energy sale.
  - **TotalStakeOverride:** Manually override the total stake used for rate calculations.

- **Rate Parameters & Smoothing Factors:**  
  - **GenerationRateSmoothFactor:** Controls smoothing for energy generation rates.
  - **ExchangeRateSmoothFactor:** Controls smoothing for energy exchange rates.
  - **AnnualPercentageRate (APR):** Expressed in 10ths of a percent (e.g., 100 equals 10%).
  - **MultiplierCoefficients:** An array of four coefficients ([a, b, c, d]) for calculating the warehouse capacity multiplier using a polynomial (`a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d`).

## Extrinsics Overview

All extrinsics require a privileged origin (specified by `T::ManageOrigin`). Below is a description of each extrinsic and the associated input parameters.

### 1. force_set_energy_burn

- **Purpose:**  
  Override the energy burn value for the current session.

- **When to Use:**  
  - **Testing:** Simulate specific energy burn conditions.
  - **Correction:** Adjust a misreported or anomalous energy burn measurement.

- **Input Parameters:**  
  - `amount: Option<EnergyOf<T>>`  
    - **Type:** Option of the pallet’s balance type (alias for `T::Balance`).
    - **Meaning:**  
      - A numeric value representing the energy burned (measured in the unit defined by your runtime).
      - Passing `None` reverts the override so that the pallet uses the accumulated session value.

- **Event Emitted:**  
  - `EnergyBurnForceSet`

---

### 2. force_set_energy_sale

- **Purpose:**  
  Manually override the energy sale value for the current session.

- **When to Use:**  
  - **Testing/Debugging:** Simulate different energy sale scenarios.
  - **Correction:** Adjust for inaccuracies in automatically recorded sales data.

- **Input Parameters:**  
  - `amount: Option<EnergyOf<T>>`  
    - **Type:** Option of the pallet’s balance type.
    - **Meaning:**  
      - A specific value for energy sale amount.
      - Passing `None` disables the override, allowing the pallet to revert to its default behavior.

- **Event Emitted:**  
  - `EnergySaleForceSet`

---

### 3. force_set_total_stake

- **Purpose:**  
  Override the total stake value used in exchange rate calculations.

- **When to Use:**  
  - **Testing:** See how the exchange rate responds to different total stake values.
  - **Correction:** Fix situations where the automatically derived total stake does not meet expected values.

- **Input Parameters:**  
  - `amount: Option<StakeOf<T>>`  
    - **Type:** Option of the stake type (alias for `T::Balance`).
    - **Meaning:**  
      - A numeric value representing the total stake.
      - Passing `None` causes the pallet to fall back to the automatically calculated stake from the staking module.

- **Event Emitted:**  
  - `TotalStakeForceSet`

---

### 4. set_generation_rate_smooth_factor

- **Purpose:**  
  Set the smoothing factor for the energy generation rate.

- **Why It Matters:**  
  Smoothing mitigates sudden changes by blending new data with historical values.

- **Input Parameters:**  
  - `value: u32`  
    - **Type:** Unsigned 32-bit integer.
    - **Meaning:**  
      - A value greater than 0.
      - **1:** Disables smoothing (only the new value is used).
      - **>1:** Increases the weight of historical data, reducing volatility in the computed generation rate.

- **Event Emitted:**  
  - `GenerationRateSmoothFactorUpdated`

---

### 5. set_exchange_rate_smooth_factor

- **Purpose:**  
  Set the smoothing factor for the exchange rate calculation.

- **Why It Matters:**  
  This parameter controls how new exchange rate values are blended with previous ones to minimize abrupt changes.

- **Input Parameters:**  
  - `value: u32`  
    - **Type:** Unsigned 32-bit integer.
    - **Meaning:**  
      - Must be greater than 0.
      - Determines the weight given to new versus old exchange rate values; a value of 1 means no smoothing, while higher values increase the influence of past data.

- **Event Emitted:**  
  - `ExchangeRateSmoothFactorUpdated`

---

### 6. set_annual_percentage_rate

- **Purpose:**  
  Update the annual percentage rate (APR) used in exchange rate computations.

- **Why It Matters:**  
  The APR influences the economic incentives and conversion rates between energy metrics and token values.

- **Input Parameters:**  
  - `value: u32`  
    - **Type:** Unsigned 32-bit integer.
    - **Meaning:**  
      - Represents the APR in 10ths of a percent.
      - For example, a value of **100** corresponds to an APR of **10%**.

- **Event Emitted:**  
  - `AnnualPercentageRateUpdated`

---

### 7. set_multiplier_coefficients

- **Purpose:**  
  Update the coefficients for the warehouse capacity multiplier calculation.

- **Why It Matters:**  
  The warehouse capacity multiplier adjusts the exchange rate based on the current utilization of the warehouse's capacity. The polynomial used is:
  multiplier = `ax^3 + bx^2 + c*x + d`

where **x** is the percentage of the warehouse’s capacity currently in use.

- **Input Parameters:**  
- `a: FixedI128`  
- `b: FixedI128`  
- `c: FixedI128`  
- `d: FixedI128`  
  - **Type for Each:** A fixed-point 128-bit integer.
  - **Meaning:**  
    - These coefficients determine the shape of the polynomial.
    - Adjust them to modify how aggressively the multiplier reacts to changes in warehouse capacity (e.g., encouraging higher capacity utilization by altering economic incentives).

- **Event Emitted:**  
- `MultiplierCoefficientsUpdated`

## Underlying Calculations and Mechanics

### Energy Generation Calculation

- **Basis:**  
The generation rate is calculated based on the energy burn value.

- **Smoothing:**  
The new generation rate is blended with the previous session’s rate using a weight computed as:
`weight = 2 / (smooth_factor + 1) smoothed_rate = weight * new_rate + (1 - weight) * old_rate`


### Exchange Rate Calculation

- **Formula:**  
The exchange rate is derived from several factors:
- **Numerator:**  
  ```
  energy_sale * constant_factor * SECONDS_IN_YEAR * fixed_divisor
  ```
- **Denominator:**  
  ```
  total_stake * apr * duration * multiplier
  ```
The result is then smoothed similarly to the generation rate.

### Warehouse Capacity Multiplier

- **Calculation:**  
- Compute **x** as:
  ```
  x = (current_amount / max_capacity) * 100
  ```
- Evaluate the polynomial:
  ```
  multiplier = a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d
  ```
- If the multiplier is non-positive, a warning is logged and it defaults to one.

## Practical Use Cases

- **Testing and Simulation:**  
Use the `force_set_` extrinsics to simulate various economic scenarios without relying solely on live data.

- **Adjusting System Responsiveness:**  
Modify the smooth factors to control how reactive the system is to sudden changes in energy metrics.

- **Economic Policy Tuning:**  
Change the APR and multiplier coefficients to reflect new economic models or to adjust network incentives.

- **Debugging:**  
In the event of unexpected behavior, manually overriding key values can help pinpoint issues or stabilize operations until a more permanent solution is applied.

## Invoking Extrinsics

These extrinsics can be called via:

- **Substrate UI (Polkadot.js Apps):**  
Navigate to the Dynamic Energy pallet, select an extrinsic, fill in the parameters, and submit the transaction using an account with appropriate privileges.

- **CLI Tools (e.g., Subxt):**  
Construct and submit extrinsics programmatically. For example:
```
// Example using Subxt:
let call = dynamic_energy::calls::ForceSetEnergyBurn { amount: Some(1000) };
api.tx().dynamic_energy().force_set_energy_burn(call).sign_and_submit(&admin_key)?;
```

### Exchange Rate Calculation

- **Formula:**  
The exchange rate is derived from several factors:
- **Numerator:**  
  ```
  energy_sale * constant_factor * SECONDS_IN_YEAR * fixed_divisor
  ```
- **Denominator:**  
  ```
  total_stake * apr * duration * multiplier
  ```
The result is then smoothed similarly to the generation rate.
